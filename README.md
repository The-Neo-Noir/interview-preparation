interviewing.io - practice your one-on-one interviewing with a peer. It’s good free practice, and as you get better interviewing.io will try to make a recruiting commission off of you by matching you with a real employer.
Interview Cake - a lot of interview questions are “progressive”; they start with a simple question and have a lot of follow up questions, allowing the interviewer to fill up the hour they have with you, irrespective of how fast or slow you are to answer their questions. Interview Cake helped Paul get better at that specific interview format.
